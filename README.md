## Inspiration: 
This generation of women is independent, strong, outspoken, paid and confident! We wanted to create something that benefits them and helps them to build a better community altogether.

## Problem Statement: 
Women suffer from a plethora of health issues and the most common ones are with respect to pregnancy, PCOS and menstrual health. The fact that there wasn't any priority given to research in the field of women's reproductive system until the mid 1900s and the stereotypes in the society further add to the overall problem.

## Solution:
We aim to build an app that will help us reach every corner of the country and hopefully the entire world, someday. We aim to intensifya strong community of self aware women who can take care of themselves and others and build a sisterhood which teaches women that they are not alone. By giving them these facilities we are empowering them towards a society which will provide them with the basic rights such as health care.

## What it does
It is a one-stop solution to monitor your health, water intake, track your periods and even seek professional help.

## How we built it
We designed it using Figma and the prototype was made using Framer X. We used Java and Android studio for the implementation of the app.

## Challenges we ran into
There were definitely a few hiccups and we ran into quite a few problems. This is our first time building an app and we had trouble with android studio, it took us quite a bit of effort to get the hang of it and get the app up and running. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have learnt so much over the last few days, from designing using Figma and building a prototype. The implementation of the code was the hardest part and we're extremely proud to present-MeThree.

## What we learned
1. Java
2. Figma
## What's next for MeThree
1. Integration with medical companies like practo, etc.
2. Addition of a chat bot.
3. Collaborating with NGOs and other women organizations.

## Setting up the app
This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the gradlew build command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

There are two Gradle tasks for testing the project:

connectedAndroidTest - for running Espresso on a connected device
test - for running unit tests
